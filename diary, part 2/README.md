# BTCIOT - bitcoin mesh diary, part 1

In the last diary entry we focused on building a very simple mesh network with broadcast and unicast capabilities. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DN4L_vdwA4

In this entry I experiment with range, and try and broadcast data across 1.2km of the bitcoin mesh network.

The eventual goal is to be able to blanket my local village in bitcoin transaction data, to be able to send, receive and broadcast bitcoin transactions using a freely accessible, censorship-resistant, self-healing, self-organising mesh network.
