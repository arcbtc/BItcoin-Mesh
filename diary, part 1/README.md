# BTCIOT - bitcoin mesh diary, part 1

[![BTCIOT](https://i.imgur.com/MFQwEzz.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DN4L_vdwA4)


In this first diary entry, we focus on building a very simple mesh network with broadcast and unicast capabilities. 

The eventual goal is to be able to blanket my local village in bitcoin transaction data, to be able to send, receive and broadcast bitcoin transactions using a freely accessible, censorship-resistant, self-healing, self-organising mesh network.

Contributors are very welcome!
